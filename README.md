# Pintos
This repo contains skeleton code for undergraduate Operating System course at Wuhan University. 

[Pintos](http://pintos-os.org) is a teaching operating system for 32-bit x86, challenging but not overwhelming, small
but realistic enough to understand OS in depth (it can run on x86 machine and simulators 
including QEMU, Bochs and VMWare Player!). The main source code, documentation and assignments are developed by Ben Pfaff and others from Stanford (refer to its [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).

## Acknowledgement

This source code is adapted from professor ([Ryan Huang](https://github.com/ryanphuang)) at JHU, who also taught a similar undergraduate OS course. He made some changes to the original Pintos labs (add lab0 and fix some bugs for MacOS).
